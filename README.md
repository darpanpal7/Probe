# Probe
A Fast File System Search tool.


## How to use :
    When using for the first time, the program will create a snapshot of your current file system and store it in
    'database', it might  take upto a minute (only for the first time), and after that you can search the keyword
    and lookup the file or folder. And thereafter if  you want to search for files it will provide you results
    instantaneously (not like the Windows Search :P).
